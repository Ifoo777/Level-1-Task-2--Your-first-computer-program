# Level 1 Task 2 -Your first computer program

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called greeting.js

● Inside this file, write JavaScript code to take in a user’s name and then
print out the name.

● Also, take in a user’s age and print out the age.

● Finally, output a newline character (essentially the same as pressing enter,
to move the output to a new line) and the string “It’s nice to meet you!”

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called shopping.js

● Write a program that takes items to make a shopping list. Store them as
variables item1, item2 and item3. The user needs to input each item.

● Output each item separately.

● E.g. your program could print:
My Shopping List:
Milk
Lettuce
Frozen pizza
